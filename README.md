# Project Title: Card Game Analysis

### Overview
- This project involves analyzing data from a card game played with housemates. The primary goal was to understand the game dynamics and calculate the financial transactions (debts) between players based on the game's outcomes.

## Features
- Data analysis and visualization of the card game played.
- Predictive modeling using Logistic Regression
- Cross-validation for model evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning for model optimization
